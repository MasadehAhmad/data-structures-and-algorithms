# Singly Linked List
We create a Linked List 

## Challenge
The Challenge is to create a Linked List and some method like insart and includes and ToString

## Approach & Efficiency
The creation will take O(1) complexity
The insart method will take O(1) complexity
The ToString method will take O(n) complexity

## API
insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list 

includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.

to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"[ a ] -> [ b ] -> [ c ] -> NULL"
